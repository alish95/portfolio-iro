short-description: Bloc Jams an interactive, digital music player.
---

Bloc's Frontend Foundation section teaches HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery by having students build a Spotify-like digital music player from scratch. The app is built iteratively over many checkpoints beginning with HTML & CSS Styles, then incorporating vanilla JavaScript before finally converting it to jQuery.

During the last checkpoint of the Frontend Foundation portion, I deployed Bloc Jams using Netlify.

## Method

The project was constructed in two phases. In the first phase, I learned the basics of front end web development, building the pages step by step over many checkpoints. In the second phase, a mostly functional music player was built, where it was then refactored into Angular. Through each step, I had the guidance of the course materials, the web, and my mentor.

## Challenge

The challenges of this project were the learning curve and the implementation. I had trouble keeping the current song playing while navigating between pages of the application. The problem I also spent the most time solving was the volume control on the player bar. Many of the problems I encountered was attributed to my lack of understanding concepts such as Angular's model-view-controller paradigm and configuring dependencies.

As a result, this meant spending countless hours debugging and problem-solving when things didn't go as expected.

## Solution

After going through my code, I realized many of my errors were syntax and reference related. In the future, I have to be more careful.

## Lessons

This project gave me a preview of what it was like to build a single-page application from scratch, but with guidance from Bloc. I learned that the first impression of the landing page was extremely important because it would set the tone for the rest of the application. In Bloc Jams' landing page the color palette was vibrant, but not too strong. The overall navigation was sleek, yet minimalistic. More importantly, this was my first exposure to a framework using model-view-controller paradigm.
